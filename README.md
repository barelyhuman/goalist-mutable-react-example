# Goalist Mutable React Example

This example is an attempt to work with [babel-plugin-mutable-react-state](github.com/barelyhuman/babel-plugin-mutable-react-state) on a simpler project to see how complicated would learning the new state handler be.

**note**: This is a hacker style project, so there's going to be no explanation and the only way to figure out is to go through the code yourself

## Local Setup

```sh
# clone the repo
cd repo
yarn
yarn dev # to run the dev server
```
